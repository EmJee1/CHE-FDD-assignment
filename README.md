# CHE FDD Assignment

<!-- Describe where this readme is about.  -->

This is a project made for a CHE assignment (university of applied sciences).

The repo contains the public website & backend for the CHE FDD assignment I made. The website is made with Nuxt 3 and
for the back-end we use firebase functions.
